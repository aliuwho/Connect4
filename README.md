# Connect4
The classic 6x7 board game, Connect 4.

All graphics for this project were created by me.


## Notes
This is a personal project I created to familiarize myself with Android Studio. 
My main goal was to create a mobile game with working visual components and user interaction.
As a bonus, I've added rotation support so that you can play horizontally or vertically--or switch between the two :^)

This project features a simple Connect 4 game which can be run on Android devices. There are two modes which players can choose from: easy and normal. 
In both modes, the player's opponent is a computer.

In the future, I may add multiplayer modes (starting with a local version).


### Opponent Logic
Easy Mode: The computer randomly selects a column to play a chip.
Normal Mode: Although Connect 4 is a fairly simple game, there are still many different plays to consider. 
In normal mode, the computer checks all possible moves to find the best play.
